## Overview

**uk_biobank_cardiac** is a toolbox used for processing and analysing cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images from the [UK Biobank Imaging Study](http://imaging.ukbiobank.ac.uk/). It consists of several parts:

* pre-processing the original DICOM images, converting them into NIfTI format, which is more convenient for image analysis;
* training fully convolutional networks for short-axis and long-axis CMR image segmentation;
* deploying the networks to new images.
